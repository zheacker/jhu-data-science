My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first Rmd file.  
Here, we're going to load some data:

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
test = seq(1:5)
```

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
require(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

You can also do basic markdown stuff like an unordered list:

* list 1
* list 2

The following is just a brief test to show that R objects persist across code chunks within an R markdown document.

```{r}
test[4]
```
