# Syllabus
There are 2 main components to this first course:

1. a conceptual intro to data
2. a practical intro to git/.md/R

This class is mostly pointless as I already know most of this. So its primary use will be to learn how .Rmd notebooks behave under version control. Below, I have 2 code chunks. The first has not been run; it just says `plot(cars)` and this file was saved with that result cleared (so it's also absent from the .nb.html file). The 2nd code chunk is exactly the same, except that the results have been executed, the plot appears below the code chunk, and the plot is present in the .nb.html file.




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
