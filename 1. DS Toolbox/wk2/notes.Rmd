# Intro
This week is about the basic tools we're using. I know this shit. Just gonna breeze through it.

## CLI
They talk about basic CLI commands: pwd, clear, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, cp, rm, mv, echo.

## Git
I'm using gitkraken and trying out git flow for the first time. Kewl.

## Basic Markdown
They do headings and lists. Heady topics here.

## Installing R Packages
Install multiple packages: `install.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2", "pkg3"))`. Load packages with `library(packageName)`.

Since I'm using the docker images, I'll install every package required for the entire specialization during the image build process. This will mean a bloated image, but the correct packages should always just *be there*.

## Installing Rtools
These are windows tools for building R packages, which I won't need because I'm not on windows and not building R packages (yet).
