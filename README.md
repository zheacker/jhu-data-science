# Johns Hopkins University - Data Science Specialization
This repo houses all of my personal work pertaining to the JHU Data Science courses on Coursera. Each course is 4 weeks long, with assignments and projects scattered throughout. The capstone project is not included (I'm not paying for this shit...).

## Environment
See the Docker directory for information on building the docker image and launching the container. This repo should be `-v` mounted inside the docker container at `/opt/project`, then open the RStudio project. Each week's notes/assignment/project is contained within a single .Rmd file (alongside the accompanying .nb.html file).

## Course 1: The Data Scientist's Toolbox
This course is just some basic theory about data science and some irrelevant practical details re: setting up RStudio and git.

## Course 2: R Programming
This course is a brief into to R, RStudio, and the basic objects and functions used in data analysis.

## Course 3: Getting & Cleaning Data
This course covers reshape2, dplyr, etc., the best dataset manipulation tools.

## Course 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Tools for exploring data, and how to use visualization to help.

Additional courses will be posted as they're completed.
